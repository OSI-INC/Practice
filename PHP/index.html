<p>Greetings from within index.html. This file will be loaded by a browser directed at this folder. But if we connect to a php server operating in this directory, the server will load index.php in preference to index.html.</p>

<p>If you want the php server to load this file, remove the index.php file from the PHP folder.</p>
