INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE FOURTH HUNT
--------------------------------

The fourth hunt is harder than those that came before. Only a programmer can
make it through this hunt, for it is a programmer's hunt. 

Your first task is to count the number of times the lower-case letter "o" occurs
in the file Ocean/TDG.html and divide it by the number of times the upper-case
letter "E" occurs in the same file. Truncate to the nearest integer. Save this
number to a file called Ocean/o_div_E.txt. The Hunt Manager will print the next
clue right to your terminal.
