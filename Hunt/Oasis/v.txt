This is the second clue of Hunt Three. Well done so far. The only letter that
was not in the first clue was the letter V. And so you have found your way 
here. Consider the nubmer 380. Divide it by ten. Subtract two. What number 
do you get? Call this number X. For X it is. And it shall be called X. Now,
what number, call it Y, is such that, when you multiply Y by itself, you get
the number X? That is: X = Y * Y. Find this number Y and look for a file
named after this special number. Execute the file.
