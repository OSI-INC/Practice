This song is great to listen to in the summer. 

Here are my favorite lyrics from this song:
"but do you remEmber?
remember when I pulled up and sAid, "Get in the car"
and then canceled my plans Just in case you'd call?
back when I waS livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
'meet Me behind the mall'"

This song is about a boy. Rearrange the letters to find a boy's name.
Create a text file called "Betty.txt" with this name as the contents.
