TREASURE HUNT INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------

Greetings treasure-hunter. Below is a list of Linux commands that will help you
to the end of the treasure hunt, where you will find a GOLD COIN on this
computer. In the descriptions, we use "dirname" to mean the name of a directory,
and "filename" for the name of a file.

Move up one level in the directory tree:
cd ..

Move down one level into dirname in the directory tree:
cd dirname

List files in the current directory:
ls

Print the current full directory name to the console:
pwd

Move to your home folder:
cd ~

Print the contents of a file to the console:
cat filename

Print the string in double-quotes to the console:
echo "Hello World"

Write the string in double-quotes to a file called filename:
echo "Hello World" > filename

Execute a command in the terminal, where the command is "commandname":
commandname

Execute a local program file in the terminal:
./filename

Remove a file (also called deleting a file):
rm filename

Rename a file (also called moving a file):
mv filename newfilename

Your first clue will be in a file called Hunt1.txt or Hunt2.txt, and so on, 
depending upon which hunt you are going on. Find that file and print out its
contents to the screen to get the first clue.

Enjoy the Hunt, Kevan
