The power of three that is two is not sixteen, but the number that
is three times three times three, which is something else. So there
is no point looking here for the cube of three, because it is not
here. Although I do think that sixteen is a fine number because it
is the fourth power of two, so if the fourth power of two is what
you are looking for, you should take with you the number six and
look for something that is tall and made of stone.
