INSTRUCTIONS FOR HUNT THREE
---------------------------

These are the instructions for Hunt Three, which is also called the Third Hunt,
on account of the number of the hunt being slighly greater than two, but most
definitely less than four, while being far higher than zero, without question.
You should understand that jumping ahead in the hunt could result in your
missing a clue and failing to find the treasure, forcing you to go back to the
start. Now, your first clue is this: all letters of the alphabet appear in this
paragraph, except for one. Find a file that is named after this one letter and
read what's in the file.
