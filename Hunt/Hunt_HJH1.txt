Hello. Welcome! 
The treasure hunt requires that the tclsh and wish utilities be installed. At
your terminal prompt type the following commands. You should get the same 
answers printed below each command. If not, consult with the Hunt Author.

% which tclsh
/usr/bin/tclsh
% which wish
/usr/bin/wish

Assuming you have tclsh and wish installed in the correct location, start the
Hunt Manager process by executing the following command in the main Hunt
directory.
./m &

This will run in the background. Your first question will pop up once it begins running.
