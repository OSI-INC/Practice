Flashing lights
And we took a wrong turn
And we fel down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it sems
And spinning out of ontrol

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't yo flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curius minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' aound me
I hould have slept with one eye open at night
