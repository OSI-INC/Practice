Well well well, you made it! Good job with that one..I've been thinking about falling down rabbit holes lately, and how easy it can be to get lost like that. I bet our sister feels like that a lot..where do you think she gets lost? Make a text file in the 1989 directory called "ALICE" with the mystery location as its text. Note: The first letter of the location should be capitalized.
