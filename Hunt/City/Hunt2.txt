INSTRUCTIONS FOR HUNT TWO
-------------------------

At each step of the hunt, you will receive a number. Add all these numbers together.
When you reach the end of the hunt, you will use the sum to get your coin. Your 
first task is to find a file named after the cube of the number three and print its contents.

Enjoy the hunt, Kevan
