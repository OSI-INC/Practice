Nice job finding me. The idea that you as a person are simply the construct of what other people project onto you is an interesting one. Often people project Taylor as a serial-dater, as "boy crazy". She wrote a song once, really leaning into this character. Boys only want love if its torture...go to the album this song is in, and select the appropriate text file.
